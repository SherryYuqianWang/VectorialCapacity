## Introduction

This repository contains the code for manuscript: Optimizing malaria vector control: A systematic review and mathematical modelling study to identify desirable characteristics of novel tools in different settings.


## Requirements

**Note**: Sensitivity analysis was performed using R version 4.1.0..

## Usage

 - The function to compute vectorial capacity in the entomology model and intervention model are included in the folder 1_function. The imput value of entomoloty and intervention parameters are listed in the folder 2_parameter.
 - Sensitivity analysis of entomology model and intervention model are performed in folder 3_entomology and folder 4_intervention. The RDS output are saved in folder 5_output.
 - Code for ploting can be found in folder 6_plot.
